# databases


## Features

- Paginator - iterate through entities in the Database by using Offset and Limit in the background to "page" through your entries but in your code all you need is to call `Next()`
- Sql Builders (JOINS not yet supported)
- Dialect abstraction


## Code generator

For a sql model with code generator see [gensql](https://github.com/go-zero-boilerplate/gensql). It currently generates entities, iterators and repositories.
